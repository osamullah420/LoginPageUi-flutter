# Login UI

## Introduction

This is a simple and attractive Login UI created using Flutter, a popular UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. In this project, we have utilized various common widgets like **Row** and **Column** to organize the UI components efficiently. Additionally, we have integrated assets such as custom fonts and images to enhance the visual appeal of the login interface.


## Dependencies
In this I have used custom fonts and images. So in order to run the project you must import the dependencies in your pubspec.yaml and be sure to pubg get it.
