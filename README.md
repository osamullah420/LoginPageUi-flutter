# Login UI



## Introduction

This is a simple and attractive Login UI created using Flutter, a popular UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. In this project, we have utilized various common widgets like **'Row'** and **'Column'** to organize the UI components efficiently. Additionally, we have integrated assets such as custom fonts and images to enhance the visual appeal of the login interface.

# Customizing Fonts and images

* In the pubspec.yaml file, make sure to include the new font files under the flutter section.


## Images

* To display an image in your Flutter application, you can use the Image.asset widget.
